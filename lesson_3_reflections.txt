When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with other users

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You want to be in control of when the local repository should be cloned/overwritten
Remote repo may not be a "working" version of the code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a "clone" done on the github servers
A clone is done between github<->local repository or local<->local
A branch is a new local repo taken from the local master
Fork would be used when "cloning" an existing repo on github - or to credit the original creator of repo
Clone is used to make a local copy from github or between users
Branch is used when working on various aspects of same project or in collaboration with others

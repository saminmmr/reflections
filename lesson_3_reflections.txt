When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with other users

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You want to be in control of when the local repository should be cloned/overwritten
Remote repo may not be a "working" version of the code
